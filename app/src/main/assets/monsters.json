Its forelegs are extremely powerful and can kill prey in one brutal blow. Despite its hulking size, Zinogre is very agile and is able to perform many impressive maneuvers. The spikes on its body mostly lie flat, but when it has built up an electric charge they stick out vertically into the air.","PRIMARY_ATTACK":"THUNDER","SORT_BY":"zinogre","STATUSES":[{"INCREMENT":150,"INITIAL":250,"MAX":850,"TYPE":"FATIGUE"},{"INCREMENT":50,"INITIAL":50,"MAX":850,"TYPE":"JUMP"},{"DURATION":10,"INCREMENT":180,"INITIAL":180,"MAX":900,"TYPE":"PARALYSIS"},{"DURATION":10,"INCREMENT":150,"INITIAL":150,"MAX":750,"TYPE":"STUN"},{"DAMAGE":100,"INCREMENT":50,"INITIAL":85,"MAX":585,"TYPE":"BLASTBLIGHT"},{"DAMAGE":200,"DURATION":40,"INCREMENT":100,"INITIAL":180,"MAX":580,"TYPE":"POISON"},{"DURATION":40,"INCREMENT":180,"INITIAL":180,"MAX":900,"TYPE":"SLEEP"},{"INCREMENT":50,"INITIAL":50,"MAX":550,"TYPE":"MOUNT"}],"TRAPS":[{"ENRAGED":15,"FATIGUED":30,"NORMAL":20,"TYPE":"FLASH"},{"ENRAGED":12,"FATIGUED":25,"NORMAL":12,"TYPE":"PITFALL"},{"ENRAGED":0,"FATIGUED":15,"NORMAL":12,"TYPE":"SHOCK"}]},{"AILMENTS":["DRAGONBLIGHT_SEVERE"],"AKA":"Emperor of Hell","BODY_PARTS":[{"ELEMENTAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":20,"FIRE":5,"WATER":5,"ICE":5}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":20,"FIRE":5,"WATER":5,"ICE":5}}},"NAME":"Tail","PHYSICAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":30,"SHOT":25,"HIT":25}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":30,"SHOT":25,"HIT":25}}}},{"ELEMENTAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":30,"FIRE":5,"WATER":20,"ICE":10}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":20,"FIRE":5,"WATER":15,"ICE":10}}},"NAME":"Front Legs","PHYSICAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":22,"SHOT":30,"HIT":22}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":25,"SHOT":25,"HIT":30}}}},{"ELEMENTAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":25,"FIRE":5,"WATER":20,"ICE":10}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":25,"FIRE":5,"WATER":20,"ICE":10}}},"NAME":"Thigh","PHYSICAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":25,"SHOT":35,"HIT":25}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":30,"SHOT":30,"HIT":30}}}},{"ELEMENTAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":30,"FIRE":15,"WATER":25,"ICE":15}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":20,"FIRE":10,"WATER":20,"ICE":10}}},"NAME":"Head","PHYSICAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":55,"SHOT":55,"HIT":55}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":63,"SHOT":55,"HIT":63}}}},{"ELEMENTAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":15,"FIRE":5,"WATER":5,"ICE":5}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":10,"FIRE":5,"WATER":10,"ICE":5}}},"NAME":"Body","PHYSICAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":25,"SHOT":35,"HIT":25}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":25,"SHOT":30,"HIT":25}}}},{"ELEMENTAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":25,"FIRE":10,"WATER":10,"ICE":10}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":25,"FIRE":10,"WATER":10,"ICE":10}}},"NAME":"Tail Tip","PHYSICAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":21,"SHOT":10,"HIT":19}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":21,"SHOT":10,"HIT":19}}}},{"ELEMENTAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":0,"FIRE":0,"WATER":0,"ICE":0}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":20,"FIRE":15,"WATER":15,"ICE":15}}},"NAME":"Back","PHYSICAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":70,"SHOT":55,"HIT":65}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":45,"SHOT":35,"HIT":40}}}},{"ELEMENTAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":25,"FIRE":5,"WATER":20,"ICE":10}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"THUNDER":20,"FIRE":5,"WATER":15,"ICE":10}}},"NAME":"Back Legs","PHYSICAL_DAMAGE":{"Enraged":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":40,"SHOT":30,"HIT":40}},"Normal":{"DAMAGE":{"CUT":40,"SHOT":35,"HIT":40}}}}],"DESCRIPTION":"A subspecies of Zinogre with a jet-black body. It gathers bugs that eat Dragonfell Berries and uses their Dragon Element energy to boost its own power. Perhaps this is why it can survive in scorching heat or freezing cold.","ICON":"stygian_zinogre","NAME":"Stygian Zinogre","PHYSIOLOGY":"Its thunder-like attacks are different in coloring from the ordinary Zinogre; this crimson red/black lightning deals Dragon-Element damage. It is able to imbue its attacks with Dragon Element due to its absorption of multiple bugs that feed on Dragonfell berries. These bugs are red colored orbs that float around Stygian Zinogre; they closely resemble the Great Thunderbug from previous games. When released, these orbs can fly directly at the Hunter and explode on contact, dealing significant damage.","PRIMARY_ATTACK":"DRAGON","SORT_BY":"stygianzinogre","STATUSES":[{"INCREMENT":50,"INITIAL":50,"MAX":550,"TYPE":"MOUNT"},{"DURATION":10,"INCREMENT":180,"INITIAL":180,"MAX":900,"TYPE":"PARALYSIS"},{"INCREMENT":50,"INITIAL":50,"MAX":850,"TYPE":"JUMP"},{"DURATION":10,"INCREMENT":150,"INITIAL":150,"MAX":750,"TYPE":"STUN"},{"DURATION":40,"INCREMENT":180,"INITIAL":180,"MAX":900,"TYPE":"SLEEP"},{"INCREMENT":150,"INITIAL":250,"MAX":850,"TYPE":"FATIGUE"},{"DAMAGE":200,"DURATION":40,"INCREMENT":100,"INITIAL":180,"MAX":580,"TYPE":"POISON"},{"DAMAGE":100,"INCREMENT":30,"INITIAL":60,"MAX":960,"TYPE":"BLASTBLIGHT"}],"TRAPS":[{"ENRAGED":8,"FATIGUED":15,"NORMAL":12,"TYPE":"SHOCK"},{"ENRAGED":8,"FATIGUED":15,"NORMAL":12,"TYPE":"PITFALL"},{"ENRAGED":15,"FATIGUED":30,"NORMAL":20,"TYPE":"FLASH"}]}]
